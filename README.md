## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Jack 

I'm currently pursuing my M.Sc. in Mathematics at *National Tsing Hua University*. My expertise spans **financial engineering**, **large-scale matrix computation**, and **number theory**. Lately, Iâ€™ve been focusing on **quantitative trading**. Below, you'll find some of my key projects and research topics, where I apply both theoretical and practical approaches to uncover insights.

---
- **Quantitative Trading Study Group**\
Together with partners from **NTU TMBA** program, I co-founded a study group dedicated to exploring quantitative trading strategies. Some of our recent projects include: **CTA Strategies**, **Pairs Trading**, and **Factor Model Development**.
