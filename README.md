## Hi there 👋, I'm Jack 

I'm currently pursuing my M.Sc. in Mathematics at *National Tsing Hua University*. My expertise spans **financial engineering**, **large-scale matrix computation**, and **algebraic number theory**. Lately, I’ve been focusing on **quantitative trading**. Below, you'll find some of my key projects and research topics, where I apply both theoretical and practical approaches to uncover insights.

### Quantitative Trading Study Group
Together with partners from **NTU TMBA** program, I co-founded a study group dedicated to exploring quantitative trading strategies. Some of our recent projects include:
- **Building a CTA Strategy Pool and Backtesting Framework**
- **Pairs Trading Implementation**
- Factor Model Development

### Matrix Computation & Data Science
I have also worked on matrix computation algorithms and data science projects, using advanced techniques to improve efficiency and scalability:
- **Algorithms for Large-Scale Matrix Computation**
  Implemented algorithms such as **SVM**, **$k$-means clustering**, **SVD**, and **Alternating Nonnegative Least Square algorithm (ANLS)**, integrated with large matrix algorithms like **Bi-CG**, **GMRES**, **Arnoldi iteration**, and **Jacobi-Davidson** to optimize performance.

### NCTS Symposium: Computation of $\pi$
I presented at the **National Center for Theoretical Sciences (NCTS)** on numerical optimization methods for the convergence of $\pi$, utilizing Monte Carlo techniques to improve computational speed and accuracy.

### Algebraic Number Theory
I explored **Gauss and Jacobi sums** and their applications in solving power residue problems, while contributing to combinatorial models for the **Fermat Two-Square Theorem**.
