## Hi 👋, I'm Jack 

I'm currently pursuing my M.Sc. in Mathematics at *National Tsing Hua University*. My expertise spans **financial engineering**, **large-scale matrix computation**, and **number theory**. Lately, I’ve been focusing on **quantitative trading**.

---
- **Quantitative Trading Study Group**\
Together with partners from **NTU TMBA** program, I co-founded a study group dedicated to exploring quantitative trading strategies. Some of our recent projects include: **CTA Strategies**, **Pairs Trading**, and **Factor Model Development**.

---
- **Algorithms for Large-Scale Matrix Computation**\
Implemented algorithms such as **SVM**, **$k$-means clustering**, **SVD**, and **Alternating Nonnegative Least Square algorithm (ANLS)**, integrated with large matrix algorithms like **Bi-CG**, **GMRES**, **Arnoldi iteration**, and **Jacobi-Davidson** to optimize performance.
<div align="right"> <em>Technologies used: MATLAB, Python</em> </div>

---
- **Numerical Analysis**\
I presented at the **National Center for Theoretical Sciences (NCTS)** on numerical optimization methods for the convergence of $\pi$, utilizing Monte Carlo techniques to improve computational speed and accuracy.
